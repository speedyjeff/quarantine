The game starts with several countries infected with a mysterious disease which spreads to healthy people rapidly.

The only defense is to deploy one of several mitigations to prevent the spread of the disease or use one of a few drastic measures to reduce the population of both healthy and infected.

The game is played a day at a time.  To play, select the mitigations from the bottom (picture tiles) and select a country to apply them too.  With luck, you can contain the spread of the disease and save the world.

Gook luck!
